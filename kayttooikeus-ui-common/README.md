# Common frontend code

## Description

Reusable frontend code to be used with kayttooikeus UIs
 
## Build

`cd [component_dir]`

`npm run build`

Or if you don't want to install the correct node/npm versions globally, use ./install.sh (requires node and node_modules installed under ../kayttooikeus-ui-virkailija)

## Notes

Remember to build and commit the built component.

## TODO

- [ ] consider separting into its own repo to make truly reusable across projects
- [ ] enhance build script to build all (when more than one) components easily
